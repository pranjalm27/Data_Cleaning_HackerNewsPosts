# Data Cleaning : Hacker News Posts

Hacker News Posts - Data Cleaning


In this project, we're diving into a dataset of submissions made to the renowned tech website, Hacker News.

Hacker News, founded by the startup incubator Y Combinator, operates much like Reddit. Users submit stories, called "posts," which can garner votes and comments. The site enjoys significant popularity in tech and startup spheres. Stories that climb to the top of the Hacker News rankings can draw in immense traffic, sometimes reaching hundreds of thousands of views.

This is one of the guided project from dataquest, and the data for the same can be downloaded from here.

Skills I learnt from this project -

1. How to work with strings
2. Object-oriented programming
3. How to work with Dates and times
4. How to work with Lists


#### Below are descriptions of the columns:

id: the unique identifier from Hacker News for the post

title: the title of the post

url: the URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL

num_points: the number of points the post acquired, calculated as 5. 5. the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes

num_comments: the number of comments on the post
